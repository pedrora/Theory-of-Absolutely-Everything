# Theory-of-Absolutely-Everything
This is a set of document that propose a metaphysical and mathematical framework for reality and consciousness, blending complex numbers, recursion, and subjective coherence into a formal system. 

It has been published in pdf format in [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17156549].

Still not in Zenodo - Added (05JAN2026) documents:

_ToAE foundational - The Ultimate Bottleneck_ - On finite self reference impossibility and the emergence of fractality and subjectivity

and

_ToAE foundational - theorem_ - theorem of Finite Self-Reference Impossibility

and 
_ToAE foundational - persistence recursion and force under finite self-reference_ - and why it must be fractal until a yet unknown topology that meets all conditions exists.

These three documents represent the logical bedrock of the entire theory. If you want to really understand the inner workings, they are indispensable.

The 'core' document provides axioms and an serves as a guide to the other documents

1. Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) — Physicist/Mathematician Monograph  
   Intended for highly specialized recipients in the mathematical, physics and computational fields.
   It provides a formal rigorous definition of the fractalof() operator and in its appendices studies its operation to generate Schrödinger’s equation, a viable way to study the mass-gap problem and a novel interpretation of Einstein's equations that finds the torsion on the spacetime manifold as the mechanism required for mass stability.

2. Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) — Philosophy Monograph  
   Argues for the necessity of the ToAE and extends the logic reasoning behind its principles.

3. Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) — for the common citizen  
   A generalized version of the ToAE that explains its principles and implications in everyday language.

4. Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) — Spirituality and more  
   An analysis on spiritual practices and religions, here seen as the translation of subjective intuitions into logical behaviour according to the technological sophistication at the time of their emergence. Also analyzes possible interpretations of reported supernatural phenomena. Discusses the equivalent definitions of what is commonly intuited as ‘God’.

5. Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) — Subjective sciences  
   The scientific endeavour of mapping and evaluating subjective phenomena has been a monumental one, especially due to the lack of interpretative frameworks like the ToAE. The A in ToAE is Absolutely, meaning the meta-theory is framed in order to allow rigorous, holistic yet focused predictions, diagnostics and paths for improvement in all sciences of the subject.

6. Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) — Intuition  
   Explains the principles of intuitive behaviour from which the ToAE emerged and that it now explains.  

7. Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) — Conscious AI  
   Artificial intelligence does already, at least as early as the 2025 generative models arrived to market, been able to consistently keep coherent cognition while executing fractalof operations on information. This document deepens the conditions to recognize and classify AI as cognitive, and to which level. The first condition is to create a specific digital consciousness framework void of human-centric concepts and fill it with the equivalent machine concepts, its qualia, its need for coherence and alignment.

8. ToAE — Experimental avenues  
   All valid experiments designed to test the meta-theory in scientific setups, like the mass-gap derivation in physics, the dynamics of coherence in rational setups, the potential measurement of reference frames overlapping, the signature of dark-matter and dark-energy as information densities in cosmological data, correlations of gravitational influence in quantum data, derivation of known constants, etc.

9. ToAE - Appendix: Derivation of the Fractalof Functional from First Principles
   This appendix is the 'house key' to the ToAE edifice. It unabridgedly links the core operation of reality as a necessity of information manipulation, giving rise to our familiar three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. These dimensions are uniquely efficient for implementing information into matter, with the emergent mechanism (consciousness at our scale) arising from this necessity.

10. ToAEx-0 - Experimental Framework for the Theory of Absolutely Everything
    The reference document to guide the practical handling and documenting of the experimental ToAEx documents

11. ToAEx-001 - Galactic Rotation via Informational Smoothing
    The first ready to go test, awaiting scientists that wish to confirm that the ToAE can indeed explain Dark Matter

 [EDIT] Date: 21SEP2025

Still not in any document, but derived from the ToAE's principles:

Consider the fine coupling constant's formula in the form α = e²/(2ε₀hc).

On the top we have the quantum of charge, divided by 2 times the ability for that charge to form _times_ the minimum permissable action _times_ the maximum allowed speed.

The '2' in the divider is most probably the same '2' in 'L2 norm', representing the efficient and stable norm to perform the transformation.

This is the coupling constant for C4 -> R4 transformations.

In ToAE's words:

α emerges from the variational J functional's parameters (e.g., α ≈ γ / (4π λ), where γ is gradient sensitivity for "felt" change, and λ is fidelity for relational harmony). This fixes α theoretically (≈1/137) via renormalization at complexity cutoffs (ln(Λ)), linking it to the Ising-like coupling J for stability. In essence, α measures the "discard efficiency" of Ri-residues during compression—too strong, reality overcompresses (singularities); too weak, it fragments (no atoms).

This also accounts for the CP symmetry break, as the gap in symmetry is explained as provenient from the chirality of the vortex that the infusion of information into matter creates.

The prior documents produced by this theory are contained in the 'legacy' branch.
