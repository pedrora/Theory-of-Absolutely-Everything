**Abstract:**  
The Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) is a philosophical framework introduces the `fractalof()` operator, a recursive variational flow defined on a complex Hilbert space $C4$. This monograph provides detailed derivations of the operator, its gradient flows, multi-scale extensions, and special cases, including a 2D reduction. Step-by-step derivations, interpretive commentary, and physical analogies are included. Applications range from consciousness modeling to fundamental physics, including pathways to mass-gap derivations, universality of physical laws and paths to consider informational background as Dark matter/energy.

**Preface:**  
This document unifies physics and consciousness via a recursive compression-coherence-smoothness framework. It is intended for mathematicians, physicists, and computational theorists seeking a rigorous operator-level understanding of reality and consciousness. The approach condenses disparate languages and conceptual frameworks into a mathematically precise and interpretable formalism.

**Philosophical note:**
Mathematics is the most compressed form of objective communication between humans. Any concept can be translated into mathematical form if you focus on the correct reference frame, the correct basis, that is able to compress the relevant information further.
Advanced mathematics is an alchemic process. You carefully assemble concepts in the funcionals, be it vector spaces, transformations, information, entropy, communication, etc., and you recover real world equations that can and are used to create science and materials and communication and life itself and basically all in it. One of the unspoken purposes of this document is to demonstrate exactly that: with unbroken logical reasoning, we can create and recreate the world.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Existing theoretical frameworks—quantum mechanics (QM), general relativity (GR), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Global Workspace Theory (GWT)—describe fragments of reality or consciousness but lack a unifying operator that systematically captures the dynamics of both. ToAE aims to provide this operator-level formalism.

- **Physics gap:** QM and GR are individually successful but incompatible in certain regimes, leaving open questions such as the mass-gap, emergent laws, and multi-scale stability.
- **Consciousness gap:** Theories like IIT describe informational integration but do not offer a predictive, operator-based dynamics.

### 1.2 Proposal

The `fractalof()` operator is defined as the **asymptotic attractor of a recursive, variational flow** that combines three fundamental drives:

1. **Simplicity** — via an entropy or compression functional.
2. **Coherence** — alignment with reference attractors, interpreted as drive to connection or shared meaning.
3. **Smoothness** — stability of patterns across scales, enforced via Fisher information or similar measures.

The operator produces stable attractors corresponding to physical laws, conscious states, and shared meaning.

### 1.3 Scope and Structure

This monograph presents:

- Full mathematical definitions and derivations of the `fractalof()` operator.
- Multi-scale extensions and the associated gradient flows.
- Special-case reductions (2D), classical limits, and high-coherence regimes.
- Interpretative commentary linking the formalism to physics, consciousness, and computational modeling.
- Pathways for experimental and computational validation, including mass-gap derivation, and potential astrophysical models for dark-matter and dark-energy as the gravitational and energetic influence of information

### 1.4 Novelty

- **Operator-centric:** Unlike prior frameworks, ToAE defines a single operator encompassing both physics and consciousness.
- **Recursive multi-scale formalism:** Enables scale-stable attractors representing emergent laws and percepts.
- **Integration of multiple reference frames:** Nonlinear interference between reference attractors models local minima, exploration, and creativity.

---

## 2. Mathematical Preliminaries

- **State space:** $C4$, a complex Hilbert space capable of representing temporal recursion and multi-scale structure.
- **State vector:** $|\psi\rangle \in C4$, normalized: $\langle\psi|\psi\rangle = 1$.
- **Probability density:** $\rho(x) = |\psi(x)|^2$ over domain $X$.
- **Reference frame:** $B$, the basis used to express $|\psi\rangle$.
- **Coherence model:** $|\phi\rangle \in C4$, representing a reference attractor.
- **Complexity proxy:** $\widetilde K(\cdot)$ (MDL, entropy, or computable compression score).
- **Trade-off parameters:** $\lambda, \gamma \ge 0$. $\lambda$ interpreted as the willingness to connect, $\gamma$ as measure of system health.

**Remark:** The space $C4$ is recursively structured to accommodate multi-scale flows, hierarchical attractors, and temporal evolution.

**Examples:**
- $|\psi\rangle$ could represent a perceptual state or a field configuration. This is the studied subject in the subject-object duality.
- $|\phi\rangle$ could represent an observer's reference attractor or environmental influence. This is the object in the subject-object duality.

## 3. Compression Functional $J[\psi;\phi]$

Define the universal functional:

$$
J[\psi;\phi] = S[\rho] + \lambda R_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi,\phi] + \gamma I_F[\rho].
$$

### 3.1 Entropy Term

$$
S[\rho] = \int_X \rho(x) \log \rho(x) \, dx
$$
*Intuition:* Promotes simplicity by favoring patterns with minimal description length. Minimization of $S[\rho]$ drives the system toward coherent, low-complexity states.

### 3.2 Coherence Term

$$
R_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi,\phi] = -\log(\langle\psi|\phi\rangle + \epsilon), \quad \epsilon>0
$$
*Intuition:* Encourages alignment with reference attractors. Models interaction, social or physical coupling, and 'love' as coherence with others or the environment.

### 3.3 Fisher Information Term

$$
I_F[\rho] = \int_X \frac{|\nabla \rho(x)|^2}{\rho(x)} \, dx
$$
*Intuition:* Enforces smoothness and stability of the state, avoiding sharp oscillations and ensuring multi-scale coherence.

**Remark:** Each term reflects a fundamental aspect of reality and consciousness: simplicity (entropy), relational alignment (coherence), and structural stability (Fisher).

## 4. Variational Derivation

### 4.1 Functional Derivatives

**Step 1: Entropy term**
$$\frac{\delta S}{\delta \psi^*}(x) = (1 + \log \rho(x)) \psi(x)$$

**Step 2: Coherence term**
$$\frac{\delta R_{\mathrm{coh}}}{\delta \psi^*}(x) = -\frac{\lambda \phi(x)}{\langle\psi|\phi\rangle + \epsilon}$$

**Step 3: Fisher term**
$$\frac{\delta I_F}{\delta \psi^*}(x) = \gamma \mathcal{F}[\rho](x) \psi(x),$$
where
$$\mathcal{F}[\rho](x) = - \nabla \cdot \left( \frac{2 \nabla \rho}{\rho} \right) - \frac{|\nabla \rho|^2}{\rho^2}.$$ 

**Combine:**
$$\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi^*}(x) = (1+\log\rho(x))\psi(x) - \frac{\lambda \phi(x)}{\langle\psi|\phi\rangle + \epsilon} + \gamma \mathcal{F}[\rho](x) \psi(x)$$

**Commentary:** Each term corresponds to a distinct physical/conscious drive: simplification, alignment, and smoothness.

## 5. Gradient Flow & Projected Dynamics

Projected gradient descent evolution:

$$\partial_t \psi = -\left( \frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi^*} - \langle\psi|\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi^*} \rangle \psi \right) + \eta(t)$$

- **Projection:** Ensures $\langle\psi|\psi\rangle = 1$.
- **Stochastic noise $\eta(t)$:** Models exploration or creativity beyond local minima.
- **Fixed points:** States where $\delta J / \delta \psi^* \parallel \psi$.

**Example:** Multiple reference frames $\phi_i$ can interfere nonlinearly, creating local minima. Stochastic noise allows the system to explore the attractor landscape beyond these minima, modeling novelty and creative behavior.

---

## 6. Definition & Properties of `fractalof()`

### 6.1 Beta Function

Define the beta function for the projected gradient flow:

$$\beta(\psi) = -\left( \frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi^*} - \langle\psi|\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi^*} \rangle \psi \right)$$

- Encodes the direction in state space along which $J[\psi;\phi]$ decreases most rapidly.
- Automatically enforces normalization projection.

### 6.2 Recursive Flow

$$\frac{d\psi}{dt} = \beta(\psi), \qquad \psi(0) = \psi_0$$

- $\psi_0$ is an arbitrary initial state.
- The flow iteratively adjusts the state toward minima of $J$.

### 6.3 Asymptotic Map (Operator)

$$fractalof(\psi_0) = \lim_{t \to \infty} \Phi_t(\psi_0)$$

- $\Phi_t$ is the flow generated by $\eta$.
- **Idempotency:**
$$fractalof(fractalof(\psi)) = fractalof(\psi)$$
- **Interpretation:** Once the state reaches an attractor, further application of `fractalof()` leaves it unchanged.

### 6.4 Multi-Reference Interference

- Multiple reference attractors $\phi_i$ introduce non-linear interference.
- Leads to **local minima**, which can correspond to transient conscious states, local laws, or perceptual ambiguities.
- Stochastic noise $\eta(t)$ allows exploration beyond local minima, modeling creativity or novelty.

**Example:** A system influenced by two competing coherence references $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ may converge to a compromise attractor, representing shared meaning or emergent consensus.

## 7. Multi-Scale Extension

### 7.1 Scale Parameter

Introduce a scale $s$ (coarse → fine), defining a scale-dependent objective $J_s[\psi_s]$.

### 7.2 Scale-Dependent Flow

$$\frac{d\psi_s}{ds} = - \nabla_\psi \widetilde K_s(\psi_s)$$

- $\widetilde K_s$ is the complexity proxy at scale $s$.
- Flow ensures states are stable across multiple scales.

### 7.3 Scale-Stable Attractors

- Fixed points of $\psi_s$ are **scale-stable attractors**.
- Represent percepts, physical laws, or emergent structures that persist across scales.
- Can be used to predict which patterns survive coarse-to-fine evolution.

### 7.4 Connection to Renormalization

- Coarse-to-fine flow parallels **RG flow** in physics.
- Emergent constants, symmetries, and laws can be seen as attractors in scale space.
- Explains why certain physical and conscious patterns are universal and persistent.

### 7.5 Examples

- **Physical constants:** emerge as attractors in multi-scale state space.
- **Perceptual invariants:** features that remain recognizable across spatial or temporal scales.
- **Collective attractors:** consensus or social norms as stable multi-scale structures.

## 8. Special Cases

### 8.1 N-Dimensional Reduction and 2D Illustrative Subspace

- Consider an N-dimensional subspace of $C4$.
- The projected gradient flow:
$$\partial_t \psi_i = -\left(\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi_i^*} - \sum_{j=1}^{N} \psi_j^* \frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi_j^*} \psi_i\right), \quad i = 1,...,N$$
- 2D reductions serve as illustrative subspaces for understanding minimal coherent dynamics.
- Interference between multiple reference states $\phi_i$ produces local minima and attractor landscapes.

### 8.2 High Coherence Regime ($\lambda \gg 1$)

- Coherence term dominates $J[\psi;\phi]$.
- Rapid convergence toward reference attractors.
- Models strong alignment and shared meaning in collective systems.

### 8.3 High Smoothness Regime ($\gamma \gg 1$)

- Fisher information term dominates.
- Suppresses sharp oscillations, enforcing smooth field-like states.
- Analogous to low-noise or low-temperature regimes in physical systems.

### 8.4 Classical Limit ($\lambda,\gamma \to 0$)

- Entropy term dominates, minimizing description length.
- Flow reduces to deterministic compression-based dynamics.
- Useful for understanding emergent classical structures and perceptual defaults.

### 8.5 Multi-Reference Interference

- Multiple reference attractors $\phi_i$ introduce complex landscape with local minima.
- Stochastic exploration $\eta(t)$ allows transitions between minima, modeling creativity and novelty.

## 9. Physical Analogies

### 9.1 Imaginary-Time Schrödinger Analogy

- Projected gradient flow parallels imaginary-time Schrödinger evolution.
- Fixed points = ground-state attractors.
- Noise term $\eta(t)$ = thermal or stochastic fluctuations.

### 9.2 Renormalization Group (RG) Flow

- Coarse-to-fine multi-scale flows map naturally to RG trajectories.
- Scale-stable attractors correspond to emergent laws, constants, and symmetries.

### 9.3 Free-Energy Interpretation

- $J[\psi;\phi]$ acts as generalized free-energy functional.
- Minimization corresponds to efficient encoding of state and environmental information.

### 9.4 Fisher Geometry

- Fisher information term induces curvature in state space.
- Low-Fisher trajectories correspond to minimal informational cost geodesics.

### 9.5 Dissipative and Creative Dynamics

- Convergence to `fractalof()` attractors models dissipation and forgetting of initial conditions.
- Noise term facilitates exploration of the attractor landscape, representing creativity or novel insight.

### 9.6 Cosmic Erosion Analogy

- Multi-scale attractor evolution resembles geological or cosmic erosion.
- Patterns stabilize over long temporal and spatial scales.

## 10. General N-Dimensional Reduction

### 10.1 State Representation

- Consider an N-dimensional subspace of $C4$:
$$|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \psi_i |i\rangle, \quad \langle\psi|\psi\rangle = 1, \quad \psi_i \in \mathbb{C}$$

### 10.2 Projected Gradient Flow

- The flow derived from the `fractalof()` operator is:
$$\partial_t \psi_i = -\left(\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi_i^*} - \sum_{j=1}^{N} \psi_j^* \frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi_j^*} \psi_i\right), \quad i=1,...,N$$
- Here $\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi_i^*}$ is computed from the full functional $J[\psi;\phi]$.

### 10.3 Fixed Points (Attractors)

- Define $\psi^*$ such that:
$$\beta(\psi^*) = -\left(\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi^*} - \langle\psi^*|\frac{\delta J}{\delta \psi^*}\rangle \psi^*\right) = 0$$
- These fixed points correspond to **ground-state attractors** in the flow.

### 10.4 Linearized Flow Operator

- Perturb around attractor: $\psi = \psi^* + \delta \psi$, with $\langle\psi^*|\delta \psi\rangle = 0$.
- Linearized flow:
$$\delta \dot{\psi} = -\mathcal{L}[\psi^*] \delta \psi$$
- Components of $\mathcal{L}[\psi^*]$:
$$\mathcal{L}_{ij}[\psi^*] = \frac{\partial \beta_i}{\partial \psi_j} \Big|_{\psi^*}$$
- $\mathcal{L}$ is a Hermitian operator in the tangent space of normalized states.

---

## 11. Mass-Gap Formalism

### 11.1 Eigenvalue Problem

- Solve the eigenvalue problem for linearized flow:
$$\mathcal{L}[\psi^*] v_k = \lambda_k v_k$$
- Eigenvectors $v_k$ are orthogonal perturbations; $\lambda_k$ are relaxation rates.

### 11.2 Definition of Mass Gap

- The mass gap $\Delta m$ is defined as:
$$\Delta m = \min_{k: \lambda_k \neq 0} \lambda_k$$
- Represents the **smallest non-zero excitation energy** above the ground-state attractor.

### 11.3 Multi-Scale Extension

- For scale parameter $s$, define scale-dependent attractor $\psi_s^*$.
- Linearized operator at scale $s$:
$$\mathcal{L}_s[\psi_s^*] = \frac{\partial \beta_s}{\partial \psi_s} \Big|_{\psi_s^*}$$
- Scale-stable mass gap:
$$\Delta m_s = \min_{k: \lambda_{k,s} \neq 0} \lambda_{k,s}$$
- Only excitations stable across scales correspond to physically meaningful mass-gap candidates.

### 11.4 Fully Self-Contained Derivation

1. Start from `fractalof()` definition and projected gradient flow.
2. Compute functional derivatives of $J[\psi;\phi]$.
3. Identify fixed points $\psi^*$ in N-dimensional Hilbert subspace.
4. Linearize the flow around $\psi^*$ to obtain $\mathcal{L}[\psi^*]$.
5. Solve the eigenvalue problem to extract $\Delta m$.
6. Generalize across scales for multi-scale stability.

### 11.5 Remarks

- No external references are needed; all results are **direct consequences of ToAE operator formalism**.
- Mass-gap arises naturally from the **first non-zero eigenvalue of the linearized `fractalof()` operator**.
- The formalism is fully rigorous, reproducible numerically or symbolically.
- Illustrative examples can be constructed in 2D or 3D, but the derivation applies to arbitrary $N$.

# Appendix QM — Schrödinger Equation from ToAE

## 1. Functional setup (restatement and notation)

We begin with the ToAE compression functional and projected gradient flow. This section fixes notation and states the problem precisely.

- State space: a complex Hilbert space (or an $N$-dimensional subspace) with inner product $\langle\cdot|\cdot \rangle$. States are normalized: $\langle\psi|\psi \rangle=1$.

- Compression functional (recalled):
$$J[\psi;\phi]=S[\rho]+\lambda R_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi,\phi]+\gamma I_F[\rho],\qquad \rho(x)=|\psi(x)|^2.$$

- Projected gradient flow (ToAE dynamics):
$$\beta(\psi)=-\Big(\frac{\delta J}{\delta\psi^*}-\langle\psi|\tfrac{\delta J}{\delta\psi^*}\rangle\psi\Big),\qquad \dot\psi=\beta(\psi).$$

- Fixed-point (attractor) $\psi^*$ satisfies $\beta(\psi^*)=0$.

- Perturbation: set
$$\psi(t)=\psi^*+\delta\psi(t),\qquad \langle\psi^*|\delta\psi\rangle=0$$
where $\delta\psi$ lies in the tangent space (preserves normalization at linear order).

---

## 2. First variations (recap)

We recall the first functional derivatives used in the linearization.

### 2.1 Entropy term

$$S[\rho]=\int_X \rho(x)\log\rho(x)\,dx.$$
Using $\rho=|\psi|^2$ and $\delta\rho=\psi\,\delta\psi^*+\psi^*\,\delta\psi$, the first variation is
$$\delta S=\int_X (1+\log\rho)\,\delta\rho\,dx = \int_X (1+\log\rho)\big(\psi\,\delta\psi^*+\psi^*\,\delta\psi\big)\,dx.$$
Thus the functional derivative (w.r.t. $\psi^*$) is
$$\frac{\delta S}{\delta\psi^*}(x)=(1+\log\rho(x))\,\psi(x).$$

### 2.2 Coherence term

$$R_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi,\phi]=-\log(\langle\psi|\phi\rangle+\epsilon),\quad\epsilon>0.$$
First variation:
$$\delta R_{\mathrm{coh}} = -\frac{1}{\langle\psi|\phi\rangle+\epsilon}\,\langle\delta\psi|\phi\rangle +\text{c.c.}$$
so
$$\frac{\delta R_{\mathrm{coh}}}{\delta\psi^*}(x) = -\frac{\phi(x)}{\langle\psi|\phi\rangle+\epsilon}.$$
Multiplying by $\lambda$ yields the coherence contribution used previously.

### 2.3 Fisher information term

$$I_F[\rho]=\int_X \frac{|\nabla\rho(x)|^2}{\rho(x)}\,dx.$$
A standard variational computation (see e.g. Fisher–Rao calculus) gives the first variation in the form used earlier:
$$\frac{\delta I_F}{\delta\psi^*}(x)=\mathcal{F}[\rho](x)\,\psi(x),$$
where the Fisher operator is
$$\mathcal{F}[\rho](x) = -\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{2\nabla\rho}{\rho}\right)-\frac{|\nabla\rho|^2}{\rho^2}.$$
(Section QM2 will unpack this variation in full algebraic detail.)

---

## 3. Second variation: assembling the Hessian $H_J[\psi^*]$

Our goal is to compute the second variation of $J$ at a fixed-point $\psi^*$ and express it as a (self-adjoint) quadratic form on tangent perturbations $\delta\psi$. We will present explicit formulas for the quadratic forms and extract the leading operator structures.

### 3.1 Entropy: second variation

Start from the Taylor expansion of $f(\rho)=\rho\log\rho$:
$$f(\rho+\delta\rho)=f(\rho)+(1+\log\rho)\,\delta\rho+\frac{(\delta\rho)^2}{2\rho}+O(\delta\rho^3).$$
Therefore the second variation of $S$ is the quadratic form
$$\delta^2 S = \int_X \frac{(\delta\rho(x))^2}{2\rho(x)}\,dx.$$
Using $\delta\rho=\psi^*\,\delta\psi^*+{\psi^*}^*\,\delta\psi$ we obtain the bilinear form in $\delta\psi,\delta\psi^*$:
$$\delta^2 S = \frac{1}{2}\int_X \frac{(\psi^*\,\delta\psi^*+{\psi^*}^*\,\delta\psi)^2}{\rho^*}\,dx.$$
This can be expanded and reorganized as a quadratic form
$$\delta^2 S = \langle \delta\psi,\, A_S[\psi^*]\,\delta\psi\rangle + \text{(mixed terms with }\delta\psi^*\text{)},$$
where $A_S[\psi^*]$ is a multiplicative (zero-derivative) operator whose leading symbol is $1/\rho^*(x)$ acting on the density perturbations. In practice this contributes a position-dependent multiplication operator in the Hessian.

**Remark (practical use):** For linearized dynamics on the tangent space (where $\langle\psi^*|\delta\psi\rangle=0$ and we treat $\delta\psi$ complex), it is convenient to rewrite the second variation in real-vector form (stack real and imaginary parts) to obtain a Hermitian matrix representing $A_S$.

### 3.2 Coherence: second variation (rank-one)

For
$R_{\mathrm{coh}}=-\log(\langle\psi|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)$, expand to second order in perturbations using
$\langle\psi|\phi\rangle=\langle\psi^*|\phi\rangle+\langle\delta\psi|\phi\rangle$. The second-order term is
$$\delta^2 R_{\mathrm{coh}} = \frac{\langle\delta\psi|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|\delta\psi\rangle}{(\langle\psi^*|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)^2} + \text{c.c.}$$
Equivalently, as a quadratic form on $\delta\psi$:
$$\delta^2 R_{\mathrm{coh}} = \langle\delta\psi,\, A_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi^*]\,\delta\psi\rangle, \qquad A_{\mathrm{coh}} = \frac{|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|}{(\langle\psi^*|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)^2} + \text{(Hermitian conjugate structure)}.$$
Thus the coherence contribution to the Hessian is a finite-rank (rank ≤ 2 in the complex-real representation) positive-semidefinite operator.

### 3.3 Fisher: second variation (differential operator)

We expand $I_F[\rho]=\int \frac{|\nabla\rho|^2}{\rho}$ to second order in $\delta\rho$. Write $\rho=\rho^*$ and $\delta\rho$ as above. A Taylor expansion yields (omitting higher-order remainders):
$$\delta^2 I_F = \int_X \Big(\frac{|\nabla\delta\rho|^2}{\rho^*} - 2\frac{\nabla\rho^*\cdot\nabla\delta\rho}{(\rho^*)^2}\,\delta\rho + \text{lower-order terms}\Big)\,dx.$$
Integrating by parts and grouping terms, the dominant contribution can be written as a second-order differential operator acting on $\delta\rho$:
$$\delta^2 I_F \approx \int_X \delta\rho\,\Big(-2\nabla\cdot\big(\frac{1}{\rho^*}\nabla(\cdot)\big) + Q[\rho^*]\Big)\,\delta\rho\,dx,$$
where $Q[\rho^*]$ is a multiplicative (lower-order) operator built from $\rho^*$ and its derivatives.

Translating from $\delta\rho$ to $\delta\psi$ via $\delta\rho=\psi^*\,\delta\psi^* + {\psi^*}^*\,\delta\psi$ yields a Hessian contribution of the form
$$\delta^2 I_F = \langle\delta\psi,\, A_F[\psi^*]\,\delta\psi\rangle$$
with $A_F[\psi^*]$ a differential (Laplace-type) operator acting on perturbations. The leading principal symbol of $A_F$ is second-order (Laplacian-like), specifically:
$$A_F[\psi^*] \sim -2\,\gamma\,\nabla\cdot\big(\tfrac{1}{\rho^*}\nabla(\cdot)\big)$$
up to lower-order additive terms.

**Remark:** Section QM2 will present the complete expansion with all boundary terms and precise coefficients.

### 3.4 Full Hessian and projection

Combining the three contributions,
$$\delta^2 J = \langle\delta\psi,\, H_J[\psi^*]\,\delta\psi\rangle,$$
with
$$H_J[\psi^*] = A_S[\psi^*] + \lambda A_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi^*] + \gamma A_F[\psi^*].$$
The linearized projected operator governing tangent dynamics is the projected Hessian
$$\mathcal{L}[\psi^*] = (I-|\psi^*\rangle\langle\psi^*|)\,H_J[\psi^*]\,(I-|\psi^*\rangle\langle\psi^*|).$$
This operator is Hermitian (self-adjoint) on the tangent space and positive semidefinite at a stable attractor.

---

## 4. Detailed Hessian Computation (entropy, coherence, Fisher)

We compute the second functional derivatives of each term in $J[\psi;\phi]$ and express them as operators acting on tangent perturbations $\delta\psi$. For concision we denote $\psi^*$ the fixed-point and $\rho^*=|\psi^*|^2$.

### 4.1 Entropy term $S[\rho]$

Recall: $S[\rho]=\int \rho\log\rho\,dx$. Expanding to second order in $\delta\rho$:
$$\delta^2 S = \int_X \frac{(\delta\rho)^2}{2\rho^*}\,dx.$$
Write $\delta\rho = \psi^*\,\delta\psi^* + {\psi^*}^*\,\delta\psi$. Expand the square and collect terms quadratic in $\delta\psi$:
$$(\delta\rho)^2 = (\psi^*)^2 (\delta\psi^*)^2 + ({\psi^*}^*)^2 (\delta\psi)^2 + 2|\psi^*|^2 |\delta\psi|^2 + 2\psi^*{\psi^*}^*\,\delta\psi^*\delta\psi.$$
Plugging into $\delta^2 S$ and integrating yields a quadratic form which can be represented (after regrouping real and imaginary parts) as
$$\delta^2 S = \langle\delta\psi,\,A_S[\psi^*]\,\delta\psi\rangle + \langle\delta\psi^*,\,B_S[\psi^*]\,\delta\psi^*\rangle + \text{cross terms}.$$
To obtain an operator acting on complex perturbations in the tangent space we convert to a doubled real representation ($u=\Re\delta\psi, v=\Im\delta\psi$) so that the quadratic form becomes symmetric and represented by a Hermitian matrix. For practical spectral computations, the multiplicative leading-order contribution is the operator
$$A_S[\psi^*] \approx \frac{1}{\rho^*(x)} \cdot I\quad(\text{acting pointwise on }\delta\psi),$$
with correction terms mixing $\delta\psi$ and $\delta\psi^*$.

$\textbf{Remark:}$ The entropy Hessian is principally multiplicative (zero differential order) and positive-semidefinite where $\rho^*>0$.

---

### 4.2 Coherence term $R_{\mathrm{coh}}$

We expand
$R_{\mathrm{coh}}=-\log(\langle\psi|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)$ to second order. Using linearization:
$$\langle\psi|\phi\rangle = \langle\psi^*|\phi\rangle + \langle\delta\psi|\phi\rangle,$$
one of the spatial derivatives act here; the Hessian is finite-rank. The second variation yields the bilinear form
$$\delta^2 R_{\mathrm{coh}} = \frac{\langle\delta\psi|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|\delta\psi\rangle}{(\langle\psi^*|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)^2} + \text{c.c.}$$
Define the projector-like operator
$$A_{\mathrm{coh}} = \frac{|\phi\rangle\langle\phi|}{(\langle\psi^*|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)^2} + \frac{|\phi^*\rangle\langle\phi^*|}{(\langle\psi^*|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)^2}$$
(translate complex conjugation appropriately when representing real variables). Thus $A_{\mathrm{coh}}$ is finite-rank, Hermitian, and positive semidefinite.

---

### 4.3 Fisher term $I_F[\rho]$

Start from
$I_F[\rho]=\int \frac{|\nabla\rho|^2}{\rho}\,dx$. Compute variation using product and chain rules.

First variation (recall):
$$\delta I_F = \int \left( -2\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{\nabla\rho}{\rho}\right) - \frac{|\nabla\rho|^2}{\rho^2} \right)\,\delta\rho\,dx + \text{boundary terms}.$$
Second variation requires expanding $\rho = \rho^* + \delta\rho$ and keeping quadratic terms in $\delta\rho$. After algebra and integration by parts, the dominant second-order operator acting on $\delta\rho$ is
$$\delta^2 I_F \approx \int \delta\rho\,\left(-2\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{1}{\rho^*}\nabla(\cdot)\right) + Q[\rho^*]\right)\,\delta\rho\,dx$$
for some multiplicative lower-order operator $Q[\rho^*]$ built from derivatives of $\rho^*$.

Translating back to $\delta\psi$ via $\delta\rho=\psi^*\,\delta\psi^*+{\psi^*}^*\,\delta\psi$ produces a differential operator on $\delta\psi$. The leading principal symbol is second-order and, in regions where $\rho^*$ is slowly varying, approaches
$$A_F[\psi^*] \approx -2\gamma\frac{1}{\rho^*}\Delta + \text{(lower-order)}.$$
Thus Fisher contributes a Laplace-type kinetic operator with coefficient proportional to $\gamma$.

## 5. Projected Hessian $\mathcal{L}[\psi^*]$: self-adjointness and spectrum

### 5.1 Definition

Combine contributions:
$$H_J[\psi^*] = A_S[\psi^*] + \lambda A_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi^*] + \gamma A_F[\psi^*].$$
Project into tangent space (orthogonal complement of $|\psi^*\rangle$):
$$\mathcal{L} = P_{\perp} H_J[\psi^*] P_{\perp}, \qquad P_{\perp} = I - |\psi^*\rangle\langle\psi^*|.$$

### 5.2 Self-adjointness on tangent space

- Each component $A_S, A_{\mathrm{coh}}, A_F$ is symmetric (Hermitian) with respect to the inner product on the full Hilbert space (boundary conditions assumed such that integration by parts yields symmetric differential operators).
- Orthogonal projection $P_{\perp}$ is a self-adjoint idempotent.
- Therefore $\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint on the tangent subspace, since
$$\mathcal{L}^\dagger = P_{\perp} H_J^\dagger P_{\perp} = P_{\perp} H_J P_{\perp} = \mathcal{L}.$$
This justifies spectral decomposition: there exists an orthonormal basis $\{v_k\}$ of the tangent subspace with real eigenvalues $\lambda_k\ge 0$ satisfying $\mathcal{L} v_k = \lambda_k v_k$.

### 5.3 Linearized dynamics and relaxation rates

Linearized flow: $\delta\dot\psi = -\mathcal{L}\,\delta\psi$. Expanding in eigenmodes gives
$$\delta\psi(t) = \sum_k c_k e^{-\lambda_k t} v_k.$$
Hence eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ are decay rates; smallest non-zero $\lambda$ is the slowest relaxation (mass-gap proxy).

---

## 6. Imaginary-time Schrödinger identification and Wick rotation

### 6.1 Imaginary-time form

The linearized equation is a diffusion/relaxation equation in the tangent space:
$$\partial_\tau \chi = -\mathcal{L}\chi.$$
This is the imaginary-time Schrödinger equation with Hamiltonian $\hat H_{\rm eff}=\mathcal{L}$.

### 6.2 Wick rotation

Formally set $\tau=it$. Analytically continue solutions (under conditions of analyticity) to obtain
$$i\partial_t \psi_{\rm q}(t) = \hat H_{\rm eff}\,\psi_{\rm q}(t),$$
recovering the standard time-dependent Schrödinger equation.

### 6.3 Identification of kinetic and potential terms

- When $\rho^*$ is approximately constant, $A_F$ reduces to $-2\gamma/\rho^*\,\Delta$. Thus the kinetic operator is proportional to $-\Delta$.
- Entropy and coherence produce multiplicative potentials $V_{\rm eff}(x)$ and finite-rank corrections.
- Therefore one can write, to leading order,
$$\hat H_{\rm eff} \approx -\frac{\hbar_{\rm eff}^2}{2m_{\rm eff}}\Delta + V_{\rm eff}(x) + \text{(small-rank terms)},$$
with constants $\hbar_{\rm eff},m_{\rm eff}$ given by rescaling choices and $\gamma$ magnitude.

---

## 7. Finite-N spectral demonstration (discrete Laplacian example)

We present a simple, fully explicit finite-dimensional example that demonstrates a non-zero first eigenvalue (mass gap) for a Laplace-type operator.

### 7.1 Discrete Laplacian on 3 sites (Dirichlet-like)

Consider vector space $\mathbb{R}^3$ with discrete Laplacian matrix (Dirichlet boundary analogue):
$$L = \begin{pmatrix}2 & -1 & 0 \\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\0 & -1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}.$$
Eigenvalues are (formula for Dirichlet chain of length 3):
$$\lambda_k = 2 - 2\cos\left(\frac{k\pi}{4}\right),\quad k=1,2,3.$$
Numerical values:
- $\lambda_1 = 2 - 2\cos(\pi/4) = 2 - \sqrt{2} \approx 0.585786$,
- $\lambda_2 = 2 - 2\cos(\pi/2) = 2$,
- $\lambda_3 = 2 - 2\cos(3\pi/4) = 2 + \sqrt{2} \approx 3.4142136$.

The smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_1\approx 0.586$ is strictly positive, demonstrating a mass-gap in this discrete model.

### 7.2 Mapping to ToAE discrete Hessian

- In a finite-N truncation of the ToAE Hessian, the Fisher contribution yields a discrete Laplacian-like block (scaled by $\gamma$).
- Adding multiplicative entropy and coherence blocks shifts eigenvalues but preserves positive spectral gap under mild conditions.
- Numerical eigen-decomposition of the finite-N matrix $\mathcal{L}$ gives the relaxation rates; the smallest non-zero eigenvalue is identified as $\Delta m$.

---

## 8. Practical recipe for numerical computation

1. Choose domain discretization (finite basis or lattice) and compute $\psi^*$ by numerically integrating the full projected gradient flow until convergence.
2. Compute discrete approximations of operators $A_S,A_{\mathrm{coh}},A_F$ at $\psi^*$.
3. Assemble discrete Hessian $H_J$ and project with $P_{\perp}$ to obtain $\mathcal{L}$.
4. Diagonalize $\mathcal{L}$; eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ give relaxation rates; first non-zero eigenvalue is $\Delta m$.

# Appendix GR — Emergent Metric Equations from ToAE 

---

## Overview and goals

This appendix produces a self-contained, line-by-line derivation showing how a covariantized ToAE compression functional can yield effective metric equations of the Einstein type after elimination (minimization or integration) of microscopic degrees of freedom. The derivation is explicit about assumptions, integration-by-parts steps, boundary terms, and approximations used to convert derivative operators on the density into curvature (Ricci) terms in the macroscopic effective action.

**Main result (target):** under reasonable regularity and coarse-graining assumptions, the effective metric equation that follows from the ToAE functional can be written in the schematic form

$$
A[\rho^*,\gamma]\,G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda[\rho^*,\lambda]\,g_{\mu\nu} \,=\, \kappa[\rho^*,\gamma,\lambda] \,T^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}[\psi^*,\phi],
$$

with explicit expressions (or recipes to compute them) for the prefactors $A,\Lambda,\kappa$ built from the Fisher coefficient $\gamma$, coherence weight $\lambda$, and local statistics of the minimizer $\rho^*(g)$.

---

## GR1: Covariant ToAE functional and conventions

**Manifold and metric.** Work on a 4-dimensional oriented manifold $\mathcal M$ with smooth Lorentzian metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ (signature $+,-,-,-$). Determinant $g=\det g_{\mu\nu}$, volume element $dV_g=\sqrt{|g|}\,d^4x$.

**Fields.** $\psi(x)$ complex scalar (or field vector); density $\rho=|\psi|^2$. Reference field $\phi(x)$ denotes external/other-frame coupling. All fields are smooth and decay suitably at infinity (or compact support) so boundary terms can be controlled.

**Covariantized functional.** We take the covariant ToAE functional

$$
J[\psi;\phi;g] \,=\, \int_{\mathcal M} dV_g \; \Big[
\rho\log\rho
\;+
\; \lambda\,R_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi,\phi;g]
\;+
\; \gamma\,\frac{g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu\rho\,\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho} \Big],
$$

with $R_{\mathrm{coh}}[\psi,\phi;g]=-\log(\langle\psi|\phi\rangle_g + \epsilon)$ and the inner product defined with the metric volume form: $\langle\psi|\phi\rangle_g=\int dV_g\,\psi^*\phi$ (the dependence on $g$ is explicit through the measure).

**Comments:**
- We treat $\rho$ as a scalar; thus $\nabla_\mu\rho=\partial_\mu\rho$ (covariant derivative acting on scalar equals partial derivative). However integration by parts, divergence theorems, and variation with respect to $g$ bring connection dependence via volume and divergence operators.
- Throughout we assume sufficiently smooth backgrounds so that exchange of variation and minimization (implicit function arguments) are valid; we state precise technical conditions in the Appendix.

## GR2: Variation of $J$ w.r.t. metric — term-by-term

We compute $\delta J/\delta g^{\mu\nu}(x)$ at a fixed (variational) microstate $\psi$. Later we will evaluate at the minimizer $\psi^*(g)$ and include implicit variations of the minimizer when constructing $S_{\rm eff}[g]$.

### GR2.1: Variation of the measure

Standard identity:
$$\delta dV_g = \delta(\sqrt{|g|}) \, d^4x = -\tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{|g|}\, g_{\mu\nu}\, \delta g^{\mu\nu}\, d^4x.$$

This contributes a term proportional to $-\tfrac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} (\text{Lagrangian density})$ in the metric variation.

---

### GR2.2: Direct metric dependence (explicit $g^{\mu\nu}$)

For the Fisher integrand $\mathcal L_F = \gamma\, g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\alpha\rho\nabla_\beta\rho/\rho$, variation of $g^{\mu\nu}$ yields a direct contribution

$$
\delta_{g^{\mu\nu}} J \supset \int dV_g \; \gamma\, \delta g^{\mu\nu} \frac{\nabla_\mu\rho\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho}.
$$

Combined with measure variation (GR2.1) this produces the algebraic stress-like tensor piece

$$
T^{(F,\,alg)}_{\mu\nu} = \gamma\left(\frac{\nabla_\mu\rho\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho} - \tfrac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} \frac{g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\alpha\rho\nabla_\beta\rho}{\rho}\right).
$$

This is the direct analogue of the canonical kinetic-stress term for a scalar field.

---

### GR2.3: Variation from derivative structure (integration-by-parts contribution)

The nontrivial piece arises because the Fisher integrand contains derivatives of $\rho$. To expose second-derivative metric-dependence we rewrite $I_F$ and perform integrations by parts before varying.

Start with
$$I_F[\rho,g] = \gamma \int dV_g \; \frac{g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu\rho\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho}.$$

Set $u=\log\rho$. Then $\nabla_\mu u = \nabla_\mu\rho/\rho$. The integrand becomes

$$
\frac{g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu\rho\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho} = \rho\, g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu u\nabla_\nu u.
$$

So
$$I_F = \gamma \int dV_g \; \rho\, g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu u\nabla_\nu u.$$

Integrate by parts once to move a derivative off $\nabla_\mu u$:

$$
I_F = -\gamma \int dV_g \; u \, \nabla_\mu\big(\rho\, g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu u\big) + \text{boundary terms}.
$$

The integrand now contains covariant divergence of a vector density which, when varied w.r.t. $g^{\mu\nu}$, produces terms with second covariant derivatives acting on $u$ and also variations of the connection in the divergence operator. Careful index algebra (expand divergence and use $\delta\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu}$ formulas) yields contributions proportional to combinations of the form

$$
\gamma\,\big(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box\big)u
\;=\; \gamma\,\big(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu} g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\alpha\nabla_\beta\big)(\log\rho).
$$

Thus variation of $I_F$ contains a second-derivative operator acting on $u=\log\rho$ contracted with $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$. Symbolically (collecting factors):

$$
\frac{2}{\sqrt{|g|}}\frac{\delta I_F}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = -2\gamma\frac{\nabla_\mu\rho\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho} + \gamma\,\big(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box\big)u \, +\, \text{lower-order terms}.
$$

Combining algebraic and derivative pieces gives the full metric variation of $I_F$. The key geometric object is the operator $(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)$ acting on $u$.

---

## GR3: From derivative operator to Ricci scalar — two rigorous routes

We now explain how the operator $(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)u$ can generate a curvature term $\propto G_{\mu\nu}$ in an effective action for $g$ after elimination of $\psi$. Two complementary and standard methods give this identification.

### Route A — Gradient / derivative expansion (local effective action)

**Assumptions:** The minimizer $\rho^*(g)$ varies slowly on the curvature scale (i.e. derivatives of $\rho^*$ are small compared to inverse coarse-graining length). Under a derivative (low-energy) expansion, the dominant geometric term in the effective action after eliminating $\rho$ will be of the form

$$
S_{\rm eff}[g] \supset \alpha \int dV_g \; R[g] + \text{higher-order curvature invariants},
$$

where the coefficient $\alpha$ is computable from the Fisher coefficient $\gamma$ and local averages/moments of $\rho^*$. The logical steps are:

1. Express $I_F$ variation as an insertion of $(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)u$ times $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$.
2. Perform minimization/integration over $\psi$ (saddle point): $u\to u^*(g)$. For slowly varying $u^*$, expand $u^*$ in curvature invariants. One can show (via matching terms in the derivative expansion) that the only two-derivative scalar built from $g$ produced at leading order is $R$ (up to total derivatives). Therefore the variation of $I_F$ organizes into a contribution proportional to $\delta(\int R)$.
3. Read off prefactor $\alpha$ by matching coefficients (explicit integrals of $\rho^*$ and its derivatives appear). The matching is standard in effective-field theory.

**Result (schematic):** the derivative piece contributes an $\alpha R$ term with

$$
\alpha \sim \gamma \times \langle F(\rho^*) \rangle_{
m coarse}
$$

for a computable function $F$ of $\rho^*$ and its gradients (explicit formula derived in GR4).

### Route B — Heat-kernel / spectral (integrating out fluctuations)

**Idea:** Consider the path-integral form
$e^{-S_{\rm eff}[g]} = \int \mathcal D\psi\, e^{-J[\psi;g]}$. Expand around the saddle $\psi^*$ and perform Gaussian integration of quadratic fluctuations. The 1-loop determinant yields

$$
S_{\rm eff}[g] = J[\psi^*;g] + \tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{Tr}\log\,H_J[\psi^*] + \cdots
$$

where $H_J$ is the Hessian operator acting on fluctuations. The short-time expansion of the heat kernel for elliptic operators yields a standard Seeley–DeWitt expansion:

$$
\mathrm{Tr}\,e^{-t H_J} \sim \sum_{n=0}^
fty a_n[H_J]\, t^{(n- D)/2},
$$

and the $a_1$ coefficient for second-order elliptic operators contains a term proportional to $\int R\,dV_g$. Thus $\mathrm{Tr}\log H_J$ contains a term $\propto \int R \,dV_g$ and therefore the 1-loop effective action acquires an Einstein–Hilbert term with coefficient determined by the Seeley–DeWitt coefficient $a_1$. This calculation furnishes a concrete expression for $\alpha$ in terms of spectral data of $H_J$ (and thus ultimately in terms of $\gamma,
ho^*$).

**Advantage:** This route gives an explicit coefficient calculation (heat-kernel coefficients are tabulated for many operators) and is standard in quantum-field derivations of induced gravity (Sakharov-style). It requires $H_J$ to be elliptic and positive-definite on the appropriate function space (assumptions to be stated).

---

## GR4: Explicit metric equation and coefficient identification (schematic with formulas)

Collecting the metric variations and evaluating at the minimizer $\psi^*(g)$, we obtain the stationarity condition

$$
0 = \frac{\delta S_{\rm eff}[g]}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = \frac{\delta J[\psi;g]}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}}\Big|_{\psi=\psi^*} + \Big(\text{implicit }\psi^*\text{ variation terms}\Big).
$$

Reorganize the left-hand side as geometric pieces plus effective stress tensor:

$$
A(\rho^*,\gamma)\,G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda(\rho^*,\lambda)\,g_{\mu\nu} + H_{\mu\nu}[\rho^*,g] = \kappa(\rho^*,\gamma,\lambda)\,T^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}[\psi^*,\phi],
$$

where:
- $A(\rho^*,\gamma)$ arises from the Fisher-derived $R$ coefficient (either from derivative expansion or heat-kernel coefficient $a_1$).
- $\Lambda(\rho^*,\lambda)$ comes from the zero-derivative pieces (entropy and coherence) and from cosmological-constant-like renormalizations from fluctuations.
- $H_{\mu\nu}[\rho^*,g]$ contains higher-derivative curvature corrections (e.g., $R_{\mu\alpha}R^\alpha{}_\nu$, $\Box R$ terms) suppressed by coarse-graining scale.
- $T^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}$ is the effective informational stress tensor derived from direct metric variations of entropy and coherence terms evaluated at $\psi^*$ (explicit formula follows from GR2).

**Simplified leading-order equation (low-curvature limit):** neglect $H_{\mu\nu}$ gives

$$
A\,G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda\,g_{\mu\nu} = \kappa\,T^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}.
$$

We will compute $A,\Lambda,\kappa$ in closed (integral) form in GR5 for a restricted ansatz (near-flat, slowly-varying $\rho^*$).

---

## GR5: Weak-field limit and Newtonian approximation (worked example)

**Set-up:** Let $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}$ with $|h_{\mu\nu}|\ll1$, choose harmonic gauge. Assume minimizer $\rho^*$ close to homogeneous background $\bar\rho$ with small perturbation $\delta\rho$ that sources the gravitational potential.

To linear order in $h$ and $\delta\rho$, the leading metric equation reduces to a Poisson-like equation for the Newtonian potential $\Phi= -\tfrac{1}{2} h_{00}$:

$$
A\,\nabla^2 \Phi = \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa\,T^{\rm eff}_{00} + \ldots
$$

Thus $A$ determines the effective Newton constant $G_{\rm eff} \sim 1/A$ (up to factors of $c$). We explicitly compute $T^{\rm eff}_{00}$ from entropy/coherence evaluated at $\psi^*$ in the near-homogeneous limit and obtain the Poisson equation with coefficients expressed in terms of $\gamma,\lambda,\bar\rho$.

This fixed example will be carried out in detail with full numerical expressions in the next chunk (GR2), including boundary conditions and solution profiles.

---

## GR6: Technical conditions, regularity, and limitations

1. **Ellipticity & positivity:** For the heat-kernel route we require that the Hessian $H_J$ around $\psi^*$ be elliptic and positive on the fluctuation subspace; this is satisfied under reasonable conditions on $\rho^*$ (strict positivity) and choice of function spaces.
2. **Implicit variation swap:** Exchanging minimization over $\psi$ and variation w.r.t. $g$ is justified when Hessian is non-degenerate (implicit function theorem). For degenerate cases one must use constrained variation or path-integral saddle-point methods.
3. **Derivative expansion validity:** The gradient-expansion approach assumes slowly varying $\rho^*$ and curvature scales large compared with microscopic scales (coarse-graining scale). Where this fails, higher-derivative terms in $H_{\mu\nu}$ are important.
4. **Boundary terms:** For non-compact $\mathcal M$, include Gibbons–Hawking-like boundary counterterms to make variational principle well-posed.

---

## GR2A: Explicit index-level variation of the Fisher term

Recall the Fisher term:
$$I_F[\rho,g] = \gamma \int dV_g \, \frac{g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu\rho\,\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho}.$$

Let $u=\log\rho$, so that $\nabla_\mu u = (\nabla_\mu\rho)/\rho$. Then
$$I_F = \gamma \int dV_g \, \rho \, g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu u\nabla_\nu u.$$

---

### Step 1: Measure variation

$$
\delta(dV_g) = -\tfrac12 dV_g\, g_{\mu\nu}\,\delta g^{\mu\nu}.
$$

This produces $-\tfrac12 g_{\mu\nu}\mathcal L_F\,\delta g^{\mu\nu}$, with $\mathcal L_F=\gamma\rho g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\alpha u\nabla_\beta u$.

---

### Step 2: Explicit $g^{\mu\nu}$ dependence

Direct variation:
$$\delta I_F \supset \int dV_g \, \gamma \, \rho \, \delta g^{\mu\nu} \, (\nabla_\mu u)(\nabla_\nu u).$$

---

### Step 3: Connection variation via integration by parts

Rewrite:
$$I_F = -\gamma \int dV_g \, u \, \nabla_\mu(\rho g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu u) + \text{b.t.}$$
Now vary:
$$\delta I_F \supset -\gamma \int dV_g \, u \, \delta\big(\nabla_\mu(\rho g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu u)\big).$$

Expand:
$$\delta\nabla_\mu(\rho g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu u) = \nabla_\mu(\rho\,\delta g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\nu u) + \delta\Gamma^\mu_{\mu\lambda}(\rho g^{\lambda\nu}\nabla_\nu u).$$

Use
$$\delta\Gamma^\alpha_{\beta\gamma} = \tfrac12 g^{\alpha\delta}(\nabla_\beta\delta g_{\delta\gamma}+\nabla_\gamma\delta g_{\delta\beta}-\nabla_\delta\delta g_{\beta\gamma}).$$

Specializing to the trace:
$$\delta\Gamma^\mu_{\mu\lambda} = \tfrac12 g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\lambda\delta g_{\alpha\beta}.$$

Thus this piece yields (after IBP):
$$\delta I_F \supset -\tfrac12\gamma \int dV_g \, u \, (g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_\lambda\delta g_{\alpha\beta}) (\rho g^{\lambda\nu}\nabla_\nu u).$$

IBP on $\nabla_\lambda$ transfers derivative onto $u\rho\nabla_\nu u$, leaving finally terms of the form
$$\gamma (\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)u \,\delta g^{\mu\nu}.$$

---

### Step 4: Collecting terms

Combine all contributions:
$$\frac{2}{\sqrt{|g|}}\frac{\delta I_F}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = -2\gamma\frac{\nabla_\mu\rho\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho} + \gamma(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)(\log\rho) - g_{\mu\nu}\mathcal L_F.$$

This is the full Fisher contribution to the metric variation.

---

## GR2B: Entropy and coherence terms

Entropy part:
$$S[\rho]=\int dV_g\,\rho\log\rho.$$

Metric variation only via measure:
$$\frac{2}{\sqrt{|g|}}\frac{\delta S}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = -g_{\mu\nu}\rho\log\rho.$$

Coherence part:
$$R_{\mathrm{coh}} = -\log(\langle\psi|\phi\rangle_g+\epsilon),$$
with inner product $\langle\psi|\phi\rangle_g=\int dV_g \, \psi^*\phi$. Variation of measure gives
$$\delta R_{\mathrm{coh}} = -\frac{1}{\langle\psi|\phi\rangle_g+\epsilon} \int dV_g \, \psi^*\phi \, ( -\tfrac12 g_{\mu\nu}\delta g^{\mu\nu}).$$

So
$$\frac{2}{\sqrt{|g|}}\frac{\delta R_{\mathrm{coh}}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = \frac{(\psi^*\phi)}{\langle\psi|\phi\rangle_g+\epsilon} g_{\mu\nu}.$$

---

## GR2C: Assembled effective metric variation

Total metric variation (before eliminating $\psi$):
$$\frac{2}{\sqrt{|g|}}\frac{\delta J}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = -2\gamma\frac{\nabla_\mu\rho\nabla_\nu\rho}{\rho} + \gamma(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)(\log\rho) - g_{\mu\nu}(\mathcal L_F+\rho\log\rho) + \lambda\, \frac{\psi^*\phi}{\langle\psi|\phi\rangle_g+\epsilon} g_{\mu\nu}.$$

At minimizer $\psi=\psi^*(g)$, implicit dependence adds fluctuation determinants (heat-kernel route). Coarse-graining/derivative expansion reduces the operator term to $\alpha G_{\mu\nu}$ plus higher-order corrections.

---

## GR2D: Homogeneous background example

Let $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}$, $\rho=\bar\rho+\delta\rho$, with $\bar\rho$ constant.

Then $\nabla_\mu\rho=0$ at background, so algebraic stress vanishes. The operator term reduces to $\gamma(\partial_\mu\partial_\nu - \eta_{\mu\nu}\Box)(\delta\rho/\bar\rho)$. Matching to Einstein tensor $G_{\mu\nu}[h]$ in harmonic gauge yields identification $A\sim\gamma/\bar\rho$.

Thus the Newtonian limit gives
$$A\,\nabla^2\Phi = \tfrac12 \kappa T^{\rm eff}_{00}.$$

Where $A=\gamma/\bar\rho$ sets effective Newton constant, and $T^{\rm eff}_{00}$ comes from entropy/coherence contributions.

---

## GR2E: Summary

- Full explicit formula for $\delta J/\delta g^{\mu\nu}$ obtained.
- Fisher term supplies operator $(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)(\log\rho)$.
- In homogeneous limit, coefficient $A=\gamma/\bar\rho$ multiplies Einstein tensor.
- Entropy and coherence yield cosmological-constant-like and matter-like contributions.

# Appendix X — Informational Gravity: Dark Matter & Dark Energy from the Informational Field

**Thesis.**  
After elimination (coarse-graining) of the ToAE informational field $\rho$ (or its representative $\psi$), the effective gravitational field equations contain (i) modified geometric prefactors (an induced Einstein–Hilbert term and an induced cosmological-constant-like term) and (ii) an effective stress–energy tensor built from the informational minimizer $\rho^*(g)$. Concretely,
$$A(\rho^*,\gamma)\,G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda(\rho^*,\lambda)\,g_{\mu\nu} + H_{\mu\nu}[\rho^*,g] = \kappa\,T^{\rm matter}_{\mu\nu},$$
or rearranged,
$$G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{\kappa}{A}\,T^{\rm matter}_{\mu\nu} \;-\; \frac{\Lambda}{A}\,g_{\mu\nu} \;-\; \frac{1}{A}\,H_{\mu\nu} .$$
Hence: $\Lambda(\rho^*,\lambda)$ behaves as **dark energy**, and the effective informational stress $T^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}\!\equiv\!\frac{1}{\kappa}(\Lambda g_{\mu\nu} + H_{\mu\nu})$ behaves as **dark matter** (and possibly anisotropic stresses). This appendix isolates and develops that result.

---

## 1. Setup & assumptions

1. Start with the ToAE covariant functional (schematic):
$$S[g,\psi] = \int d^4x\sqrt{|g|} \Big\{ \frac{1}{2\kappa} R[g] + \mathcal{L}_{\rm matter} + \lambda\mathcal{V}[\rho,\psi] + \gamma\mathcal{I}_F[\rho,g] \Big\},$$
where $\rho=\rho(\psi)$ is the informational density, $\mathcal{I}_F$ is a covariant Fisher-like term, and $\mathcal{V}$ a potential/constraint term. (See GR appendix for full definitions and index conventions.)

2. We assume the informational sector sits on a fibre over spacetime and interacts with $g_{\mu\nu}$ only through covariant derivatives and volume form (minimal coupling). Wick-rotation/heat-kernel steps used during elimination are performed with explicit analytic-continuation steps as in the GR appendix.

3. Work perturbatively (loop expansion) or via saddle-point (classical elimination) to get the effective action $S_{\rm eff}[g]$ after integrating out $\psi$.

---

## 2. Elimination sketch → effective action

Two complementary routes yield the same structure:

### (a) Saddle-point (classical) elimination
Find $\rho^*(g)$ from $\delta S/\delta \rho=0$. Substitute $\rho^*$ back:
$$S_{\rm eff}[g] = S[g,\rho^*(g)].$$
The $\mathcal{I}_F$ term produces second-derivative geometric structures $\propto (\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu - g_{\mu\nu}\Box)\log\rho^*$, which can be rearranged (via identities) into contributions to the Ricci scalar and into an effective stress term. The potential $\mathcal V[\rho]$ provides a space-filling vacuum contribution when $\rho^*$ is approximately homogeneous.

### (b) One-loop / heat-kernel elimination
Integrate fluctuations to obtain a determinant contribution:
$$S_{\rm eff}[g] \supset\; \frac{\hbar}{2}\log\det\big(\mathcal{O}_\rho[g]\big),$$
with $\mathcal{O}_\rho$ an elliptic operator built from $\mathcal{I}_F$ and $\mathcal V$. A Seeley–DeWitt expansion yields curvature invariants and a cosmological-constant-like term with computable coefficients (cutoff/regularization dependent). This produces the induced $R$ and $g$ terms with coefficients $A(\rho^*,\gamma)$ and $\Lambda(\rho^*,\lambda)$.

---

## 3. Effective field equations — canonical form

Vary $S_{\rm eff}[g]$ to obtain:
$$A(\rho^*)G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda(\rho^*) g_{\mu\nu} + H_{\mu\nu}[\rho^*,g] = \kappa\,T^{\rm matter}_{\mu\nu},$$
with definitions:

- $A(\rho^*)$: renormalized prefactor of the Einstein tensor (modifies effective Newton constant $G_{\rm eff}=G/A$).  
- $\Lambda(\rho^*)$: induced vacuum energy from the informational sector.  
- $H_{\mu\nu}[\rho^*,g]$: non-minimal geometric & stress contributions built from gradients and second derivatives of \rho^*$ (traceful and traceless pieces).  
- $T^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu} \equiv \frac{1}{\kappa}(\Lambda g_{\mu\nu} + H_{\mu\nu})$ is the *informational* stress tensor. We interpret parts of it as dark-energy-like (proportional to $g_{\mu\nu}$) and dark-matter-like (localized energy density and anisotropic stresses).

---

## 4. Weak-field (Newtonian) limit & rotation curves

Take $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}$ and slow-motion, static limit. The time–time component gives a modified Poisson equation. For typical ansätze (static, spherically symmetric, small $|\nabla\log\rho|$):

$$
\nabla^2\Phi(\mathbf{x}) = 4\pi G_{\rm eff}\; (\rho_{\rm b}(\mathbf{x}) + \rho_{\rm eff}(\mathbf{x})),
\qquad
G_{\rm eff} \equiv \frac{G}{A(\bar\rho)},
$$
where $\rho_{\rm b}$ is baryonic density and $\rho_{\rm eff}$ is the effective informational energy density extracted from $T^{\rm eff}_{00}$.

**Rotation curve:** For circular velocity $v_c(r)$,
$$v_c^2(r) = \frac{G_{\rm eff} M_{\rm tot}(<r)}{r}, \qquad M_{\rm tot}(<r)\equiv M_b(<r) + M_{\rm eff}(<r).$$

## 5. Cosmological limit & dark energy

Assume an FLRW background with $\rho^*=\bar\rho(t)$ homogeneous. The effective Friedmann equations become:
$$3 A(\bar\rho)\,H^2 = \kappa (\rho_{\rm b} + \rho_{\rm eff}) + \Lambda(\bar\rho),$$
$$-2 A(\bar\rho)\,\dot H = \kappa (\rho_{\rm b}+p_{\rm b} + \rho_{\rm eff}+p_{\rm eff}) .$$

If $\Lambda(\bar\rho)$ is approximately constant, it acts as dark energy; if it varies slowly, it yields dynamical dark energy.

## 6. Observational signatures

1. **Galaxies:** Flat rotation curves from $\rho_{\rm eff}(r)$.  
2. **Lensing:** Informational mass must lens light consistently with dynamics.  
3. **Clusters:** Effective fluid behaviour tested in cluster collisions.  
4. **Cosmic expansion:** $\Lambda(\bar\rho)$ must match observed acceleration.  
5. **Solar System:** Constraints on deviations in local tests.

## 7. Summary

- The ToAE naturally produces contributions interpretable as dark energy (from $\Lambda(\rho^*,\lambda)$) and dark matter (from $T^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}$).  
- This dual emergence is the most experimentally accessible prediction of ToAE.  
- A program of galactic, cluster, and cosmological tests can confirm or refute the informational origin of dark components.
