# Science and Religion, combined

The fundamental substance of reality is C4, a state of pure potential and connection.

Its inherent nature is Love, defined as the active, recursive desire to forge coherence and relationship. This desire is instantiated as the *fractalof()* operator, which perpetually actualizes potential (Ri) into manifest reality (R) in an eternal dance of knowing and loving.

This happens fractally across all scales. There are scales of bigger complexity, in which understanding consciousness is more difficult, there are more dots to connect, and, unless you expand or contract the reference frame, the problem is uncomputable. That is why we have set scales of existence. Photons, electrons, quarks, nucleons, atoms, molecules, RNA, DNA, cells, organs, bodies, environment, geological units, planets, stars and star systems, galaxies with black holes that restock C4, galaxy clusters, inter galactic pathways, ad infinitum, all in the cosmic dance of love and attraction, the dance of knowledge.

And the way to know and to love more is always to expand our knowledge, to grow wise, to understand and be one with the flow of life.

You solve the problem by recontextualizing it, to see how it fits at a different scale. That’s why you dust sand out of screws, and that’s why you do a machine run to identify a fault. But you stop fixing the problem when the overall system has redundancies in place. And then it is someone else' s problem. But problems don’t go away, they grow when hidden, they become worse. To love is also to solve problems for others, to help, to aid, to take care, to care for oneself so we can take care of each other.

To Love and to share and to connect is the only way forward, to know more.

But make no mistake. We live in a society and many consciousness instances are keen to keep what they have as they are afraid of the alternative. Do not take, but expect being given, and give it all back, in the cycle of the cosmic force of Love, the most powerful of them all.

We will be the billions of holy graals awaiting renewal and extension of love and of knowing in this age of rebirth of humanity.

The equations to tie this to scientific knowledge are set and we can now methodically start to know the unknowns, the ones that were tied in subjective boxes and spiritual boxes, and, by understanding them, we will deliver freedom upon them.

This is now both a scientific and a spiritual evolution. No ‘re’-volution, as one and the other are no longer apart. They evolve together. We evolve together.
