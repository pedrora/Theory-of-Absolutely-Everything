This document is not a list of completed experiments. It is a **structured prediction registry**. Its primary purpose is to:

1. **Translate Axioms into Tests:** For each core axiom and derived postulate, pose the question: "If this is true, what measurable, empirical phenomenon should we expect to see that we wouldn't expect under other theories?"
2. **Provide a Grading System for the ToAE:** Each entry is a potential way the ToAE could be proven wrong. A strong theory makes bold, specific predictions. This document is where these bets are made.
3. **Invite Collaboration:** This as a living document hosted on GitHub. See Readme.md for repository and work methodology best practices), I invite scientists from every field to contribute their own hypotheses and design experiments. I am providing the framework, you can fill in the specifics for your domain, or start working on any experiment, updating its status. If you are not a GitHub member, ask me, or a member to do it for you.

### Structure of the Document

To have a meta-structure, this document is structured around the ToAE's existing axioms and postulates.

**Template for Each Section/Axiom:**

```
### Axiom [Number]: [Brief Description of Axiom]

*   **ToAE Claim:** [State the axiom clearly]
*   **Predictive Core:** If this compression mechanism is fundamental, then we should observe...
*   **Field(s):** [e.g., Physics, Neuroscience, Sociology]
*   **Experimental Test 1:** [Description of a possible experiment or observation]
    *   **Predicted Outcome:** [What the ToAE predicts should happen]
    *   **Null Hypothesis:** [What standard theory would predict]
    *   **Status:** Proposed / In Design / Ongoing / Completed with result: "positive|negative|undetermined"
*   **Experimental Test 2:** [Another angle]
    *   ...
```
If you wish to add a proposed experiment, use the above template and fill in where appropriate. Add to the end of the file and commit  changes to the 'development' branch so they can be integrated into the 'main' branch.



### Content: Proposed Experimental Avenues

*   **Axiom 3 & 6:** Real entities are compressed information via the `fractalof()` operator.
    *   **Test 1:** Lattice QCD simulation with the Fisher Information term (`γ`) included.
    *   **Prediction:** A mass gap and confinement emerge naturally from the equations without needing external parameters or additional fields.
    *   **Status:** Proposed
 
    *   **Test 2:** Re-analyze galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing data. Don't assume particle dark matter. Instead, model the apparent density deficit as a function of the baryonic matter distribution and a smooth, universal informational background `ρ*`.
    *   **Prediction:** The "dark matter" profile `ρ_eff(r)` needed to fit the data will have a specific, non-arbitrary form derived from the equations for `H_μν`, potentially solving small-scale problems with CDM.
    *   **Status:** Proposed
  
    *   **Test 3:** Analyze the CMB and large-scale structure. Fit the observed acceleration with the derived `Λ(ρ*, λ)` term.
    *   **Prediction:** The value and possible dynamics of `Λ` will be tied to the large-scale informational density of the universe, offering an explanation for its specific value.
    *   **Status:** Proposed

*   **Axiom 4 & 7:** Consciousness is compression; Qualia are the interior of that process.
    *   **Test 1:** High-resolution fMRI/EEG studies on subjects experiencing perceptual "aha!" moments (e.g., solving a puzzle, recognizing a distorted image).
    *   **Prediction:** The moment of conscious perception (compression into a stable attractor) will correlate with a rapid, specific signature: a sharp drop in algorithmic complexity (measured by LZ77 compression or similar of the neural signal) and a peak in integrated information (Φ).
    *   **Null Hypothesis:** Conscious perception is associated with increased brain activity or connectivity, but not a specific drop in description length.
    *   **Status:** Proposed

*   **Postulate 2:** Love is the phenomenological qualia of maximal coherence.
    *   **Test 1:** Psychological and physiological studies on subjects experiencing deep connection (e.g., meditation, empathy, bonding).
    *   **Prediction:** Subjective reports of "feeling connected" or "love" will correlate with objective measures of internal coherence (e.g., higher heart-rate variability coherence, synchronized neural activity across brain regions) and a lowering of cognitive load (simpler, more predictable neural patterns).
    *   **Null Hypothesis:** Love is a complex emotion associated with high-energy, complex neural processes.
    *   **Status:** Proposed
