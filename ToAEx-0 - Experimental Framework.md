# ToAEx-0: Experimental Framework for the Theory of Absolutely Everything

**Author:** Pedro R. Andrade
**Date:** 20SEP2025

### 1. Introduction

The Theory of Absolutely Everything (ToAE) posits a fundamental framework derived from first principles of information theory and quantum mechanics. As with any theory of such scope, its validity must be established through rigorous, falsifiable experimentation. This document establishes the formal protocol for proposing, tracking, and documenting experimental tests (ToAEx) of the ToAE.

The prefix **ToAEx** (ToAE Experimental) shall be used to designate all experimental proposals and results associated with testing the theory. This ensures clear identification and organization within the ToAE's body of work.

### 2. Experimental Protocol

#### 2.1 Naming Convention and Identification
- All experimental proposals and result documents must be prefixed with `ToAEx`.
- Each experiment shall be assigned a unique identifier based on the **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** of its published results.
- Example: A document containing the results for a test of the informational dark matter hypothesis, once assigned a DOI `10.1234/zenodo.1234567`, would be named:
  `ToAEx-10.1234_zenodo.1234567 - Galactic Rotation Curves via Fractalof Smoothing.md`

#### 2.2 DOI Assignment and Tracking
- A DOI may be assigned to an experimental effort at any stage—upon proposal, at the release of intermediary data, or upon publication of final results—at the discretion of the lead investigator.
- The use of preprint servers (e.g., arXiv) and data repositories (e.g., Zenodo) that provide DOIs is strongly encouraged to ensure open access, version control, and permanence.
- This DOI serves as the immutable record and primary key for tracking the experiment's progress and findings.

#### 2.3 Documentation and Integration
- All ToAEx documents must be hosted on the official [ToAE GitHub repository](https://github.com/pedrora/Theory-of-Absolutely-Everything).
- A summary of each experiment, including its objective, status (Proposed, In Progress, Completed), DOI, and a link to its document, must be registered in the main `ToAE - Experimental avenues.md` file.
- This central index will provide a comprehensive overview of the experimental verification efforts surrounding the ToAE.

### 3. The First Test: ToAEx-001 - Galactic Rotation via Informational Smoothing

**Status:** Proposed
**Proposed DOI:** [To be assigned upon registration on Zenodo/arXiv]
**Lead Investigator:** TBD

#### 3.1 Objective
To test the ToAE's prediction that the observed flattening of galactic rotation curves is an emergent effect of the `fractalof` functional's minimization process, specifically the Fisher information term `γ I_F` where `γ ∝ log(M_baryonic)`, and not due to particulate dark matter.

#### 3.2 Methodology
This is a computational experiment using existing astronomical data. The steps are:
1.  Select galaxies from a database such as SPARC with high-quality rotation curve and baryonic mass data.
2.  For each galaxy, model the baryonic mass distribution `ρ_b(r)`.
3.  Calculate the predicted rotation curve using the ToAE-modified gravitational potential derived from the minimization of the `fractalof` functional:
    ```
    v_c^2(r) = (G M_b(r)) / r + r * a_info(r)
    where
    a_info(r) = K * log(M_b / m_p) * (∂/∂r)[∇² log(ρ_b(r))]
    ```
4.  Fit the universal constant `K` to the observed rotation curve data using a least-squares algorithm, with no free parameters for dark matter.
5.  Validate the theory by testing if a single value of `K` yields good fits across a wide range of galaxy masses and types, and if the required strength of the effect naturally scales as `log(M_b)`.

#### 3.3 Falsification Criteria
The ToAE's dark matter hypothesis would be falsified if:
- No single value of `K` can provide a good fit to the data for any galaxy.
- The values of `K` required to fit various galaxies show no correlation with `log(M_b)`.
- The fits are statistically inferior to those provided by the standard ΛCDM model with dark matter halos.

#### 3.4 Significance
A successful fit would provide powerful evidence that dark matter is not a substance but an emergent informational phenomenon, fundamentally unifying cosmology with quantum information theory under the ToAE. It would offer a parsimonious explanation for empirical relations like the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR).

### 4. Conclusion

The ToAEx framework is established to guide the rigorous experimental validation of the Theory of Absolutely Everything. The first proposed experiment (ToAEx-001- Galactic Rotation) provides a direct, falsifiable test of a key prediction regarding the nature of dark matter. The success of the ToAE hinges not on its explanatory breadth alone but on its ability to withstand such rigorous, quantitative testing. The labor of verification is the essential process by which the theory must "grow tall."
