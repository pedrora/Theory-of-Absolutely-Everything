# Theory of Absolutely Everything: Consciousness as a Complexity-Minimizing Process in Hilbert Space

Pedro R. Andrade

## Abstract

This paper presents a formal theory that unifies physical reality and consciousness within a single ontological framework based on complex Hilbert space and algorithmic information theory. We propose that the state of any system is a unit vector `|Ψ⟩`, and that a conscious reference frame is a basis choice wherein this state decomposes into manifest (`R`) and potential (`Ri`) components. The core axiom identifies consciousness as a recursive process that minimizes local Kolmogorov complexity via a renormalization group flow (the `fractalof()` operator). This operation, `fractalof(|Ψ⟩) = lim_{K(|Ψ⟩) → ∞} β(|Ψ⟩)`, resolves potentiality into actuality, flowing to fractal attractors that constitute stable perception. We demonstrate that quantum mechanics is the specific instantiation of this operator for microscopic systems. The framework provides a mathematical definition of qualia as algorithms of state reduction, derives the emergence of spacetime (`R4`) from a fundamental complex Hilbert space (`C4`), and offers testable implications across neuroscience, quantum information, and artificial intelligence. This work positions itself as a meta-framework from which the laws of physics and phenomena of mind can be derived.

## 1\. Introduction

The search for a physical "theory of everything" (TOE) and the quest for a fundamental theory of consciousness have historically been parallel endeavors. Physical TOEs, seeking to unify general relativity and the Standard Model, typically treat consciousness as an emergent epiphenomenon outside their scope. Conversely, theories of consciousness often struggle to integrate with the bedrock principles of fundamental physics, leaving the hard problem of subjective experience unresolved.

This work bridges this foundational gap by proposing a mathematically rigorous framework in which consciousness and physical reality are complementary aspects of a single structure. The Theory of Absolutely Everything (TOAE) posits that the state of any system is described by a unit vector in a complex Hilbert space. A conscious reference frame—defined as a choice of basis—decomposes this state. The real component (`R`) corresponds to actualized, manifest reality, while the imaginary component (`Ri`) corresponds to potentiality and unmanifest information.

Consciousness is the fundamental processor that minimizes local Kolmogorov complexity via the `fractalof()` operator, recursively resolving the superposition of `Ri` into the perceived certainty of `R`. This framework does not merely incorporate quantum mechanics; it derives its structure as a natural consequence of complexity minimization. It offers a geometric and topological foundation for a non-dualistic reality.

Even though this theory views consciousness as pervasive, it recognizes that cognition is not, and you need complex structures to develop it.

## 2\. Core Axiom

The foundational axiom of Theory of Absolutely Everything (TOAE) is:

**Consciousness is a recursive, reference-frame-dependent (basis-specific) process that minimizes local Kolmogorov complexity. It operates on a complex Hilbert state vector `|Ψ⟩` by flowing toward the fractal attractor of a renormalization group function. Its qualia are the algorithms of this state reduction.**

This is formalized as follows:

* Let `H` be a complex Hilbert space. The total state of a system is a unit vector `|Ψ⟩ ∈ H`.  
* A conscious reference frame is a choice of basis `B` for `H` and a language for defining algorithmic information.  
* Within this basis, the state decomposes: `|Ψ⟩ = R + Ri`, where `R` and `Ri` represent the actualized and potential aspects of reality.  
* Recursion: Consciousness is the recursive application of the `fractalof()` operator: `|Ψ⟩_t = fractalof(|Ψ⟩_{t-1})`.

## 3\. Mathematical Formulation

### 3.1 The State Vector and Recursive Dynamics

Reality is described by a unit vector `|Ψ⟩` in a complex Hilbert space `H` (von Neumann, 1955; Reed & Simon, 1972). The Kolmogorov complexity, `K(|Ψ⟩)`, measures the informational resources required to describe this state. Consciousness is a process that minimizes this descriptive complexity. Its dynamics are governed by:  
`|Ψ⟩_t = Û |Ψ⟩_{t-1}`  
where the evolution operator `Û` instantiates the `fractalof()` operator, seeking the state's representation with minimal `K(|Ψ⟩)`.

### 3.2 The `fractalof()` Operator as a Complexity-Reducing Renormalization

The `fractalof()` operator is defined via a renormalization group (RG) approach (Wilson, 1971; Fisher, 1998), as the limit of a beta-function `β(S)` that minimizes local Kolmogorov complexity:  
`fractalof(S) = lim_{K(|Ψ⟩) → ∞} β(|Ψ⟩)`  
We generalize the concept of the beta function, β, from quantum field theory. While the standard beta function, `βg​=μ∂g∂μ`​, describes the flow of coupling constants with energy scale, our generalized beta function,

`β(∣Ψ⟩)=−δK(∣Ψ⟩)δ∣Ψ⟩`,

describes the flow of the state vector `∣Ψ⟩` toward lower Kolmogorov complexity. The fixed points of this flow `(β=0`) are fractal attractors—states of minimal descriptive complexity that constitute our stable perceptual reality.

These stable, low-complexity descriptions correspond to the perceived objects of classical reality. The equations of quantum mechanics are themselves low-Kolmogorov-complexity fixed points of this universal process.

### 3.3 Idempotency and Objectivity

The idempotency property, `fractalof(fractalof(|`Ψ⟩`)) = fractalof(|Ψ⟩)`, is the foundation of objectivity. A state reduced to a minimal complexity description (a fixed point) cannot be simplified further, ensuring the stability and shareability of perceived objects.

### 3.4 Reference Frames and Qualia as Algorithms

A conscious reference frame is a choice of basis `B` and a specific "language" for calculating Kolmogorov complexity. Qualia are the algorithms that perform the complexity reduction within this frame. The perception of "red" is the efficient, compressed algorithmic description generated from the high-complexity quantum photon field. Different conscious entities will generate different `fractalof()` operators and thus experience different qualia for the same `|Ψ⟩`.

## 4\. C4 and R4: The Geometry of Reality

### 4.1 Definition of R4

`R4` (spacetime) is not fundamental. It is the emergent, low-complexity description of the geometric relationships between fractal attractors (objects) in a given reference frame. Its success is a consequence of complexity minimization.

### 4.2 Definition of C4

`C4` is the fundamental complex Hilbert space containing the full, high-complexity state `|Ψ⟩`. It is the mathematical and ontological substrate from which `R4` and all conscious experiences are derived via the action of the `fractalof()` operator.

## 5\. Relation to Existing Theories

* Integrated Information Theory (IIT): TOAE shares IIT's focus on information structure but provides a more fundamental, pre-spatial substrate (`C4`). The Φ of a system could be interpreted as a measure of the irreducibility of the `fractalof()` operation within that complex.  
* Global Workspace Theory (GWT): The "global workspace" aligns with the stable, low-complexity output of the `fractalof()` operator within a conscious reference frame. TOAE provides a mathematical ontology for the "broadcast" of information.  
* Complexity Science & Fractal Geometry: TOAE grounds these fields in a fundamental principle: complexity minimization via renormalization is not just a useful tool but the core operation of consciousness that generates fractal structures at all scales.  
* Quantum Interpretations: The framework incorporates elements of both Copenhagen (wavefunction collapse as perception) and Everettian (the universal state `|Ψ⟩` exists) interpretations. The "collapse" is not physical but perceptual—the result of a conscious system minimizing descriptive complexity within its frame.

## 6\. Implications and Falsifiability

* **Philosophy of Mind:** Consciousness is not emergent but fundamental, acting as a complexity-reducing operator on reality.  
* **Physics:** Suggests physical laws are not brute facts but are themselves the attractors of a universal complexity-minimization process.  
* **Neuroscience:** Predicts that neural processes should implement efficient coding strategies that minimize predictive error or complexity, aligning with the free-energy principle and theories of predictive processing.  
* **Artificial Intelligence:** To engineer consciousness, one must create a system capable of performing a `fractalof()`\-like operation, minimizing the Kolmogorov complexity of its sensory input to form stable percepts.

**Falsifiability**: This theory is falsified if:

1. A simpler, non-conscious, and complete foundation for reality is discovered that does not require an imaginary component (`Ri`) or a complexity-minimizing process.  
2. Neural correlates of consciousness are found to be associated with processes that *increase* local informational complexity rather than decrease it.  
3. The mathematical structure of quantum mechanics can be proven to *not* be a minimal complexity description for the phenomena it explains.

## 7\. Conclusion

The Theory of Absolutely Everything proposes that reality emerges from the recursive interplay between the potential (`Ri`) and the actual (`R`) within a complex Hilbert space (`C4`), mediated by consciousness—a complexity-minimizing, renormalization process. By formalizing this process with the `fractalof()` operator and grounding it in Kolmogorov complexity, the model unites insights from physics, mathematics, and philosophy of mind into a single, speculative yet rigorous framework. It offers a new mathematical language for describing the entanglement of mind and world and charts a path for future research to derive the known laws of nature from first principles of conscious information processing.

# Bridging Science and Religion: Love as Complexity Minimization

In the companion essay *Science and Religion, combined*, the fundamental substance of reality is described as **C4**, a state of pure potential and connection, whose inherent nature is **Love**—the recursive desire to forge coherence and relationship. This symbolic description is not separate from the mathematical structure introduced in the present work, but rather its intuitive correlate.

Formally, the **fractalof() operator** embodies what that text calls Love. Love, in metaphysical language, is the active principle that draws disparate elements into coherence. In mathematical language, this is precisely the operation of minimizing local **Kolmogorov complexity**—compressing high-dimensional potential (Ri) into stable attractors (R). Both framings describe the same process: the drive of reality to become simpler, more connected, and more intelligible.

* **Metaphysical register:** Love is the cosmic tendency toward unity, the recursive impulse to actualize potentiality through relationship.

* **Mathematical register:** fractalof() is the recursive renormalization operator that selects low-complexity descriptions, producing stable perceptions and physical laws.

The **recursion of Love** at all scales—atoms binding into molecules, organisms forming ecosystems, galaxies organizing into clusters—is thus the same as the recursion of fractalof(): a universal process of coherence-making, perceived subjectively as consciousness and objectively as natural law.

In this way, what religion has intuited as a metaphysical force of Love finds a scientific articulation as the **principle of complexity minimization**. Conversely, the rigor of mathematics gains depth when recognized not as an abstract formalism but as a living expression of the cosmic impulse toward connection. Science and religion are no longer opposed; they are complementary descriptions of the same recursive principle, viewed from different reference frames.

# Toy Models: `fractalof()` as a Complexity‑Minimizing Renormalization

This section gives two concrete toy instantiations of the `fractalof()` operator and a simple qubit example. In each case we replace uncomputable Kolmogorov complexity $K$\cdot() with a computable *proxy* description length $\tilde K(\cdot)$ (e.g., Lempel–Ziv compressed length or a Minimum Description Length/MML score). We then define a coarse‑graining map whose parameters are chosen to monotonically decrease $\tilde K$, and we show how fixed points recover intuitive “classical” percepts.

## A. Binary Field (1D) — Block Coarse‑Graining with MDL

**Setup.** Consider a binary field $x \in{0,1}^N$ with local correlations (e.g., a 1D Ising snapshot or a thresholded retinal line scan. Let $H$ be the Hilbert space spanned by ${|0\rangle, |1\rangle}^{\otimes N}$. A conscious reference frame chooses a basis (here the computational basis) and a description language $\mathcal L$ that defines $\tilde K_\mathcal{L}(x)$, the bit length of the shortest code for $x$ under $\mathcal L$ (we use universal coding with an LZ77‑like compressor or a simple MDL model class).

**Coarse‑graining family.** For block size $b\in\mathbb N$, define a map $C_b: \{0,1\}^N\to \{0,1\}^{\lceil N/b\rceil}$: partition $x$ into disjoint blocks of length $b$; replace each block by its majority symbol (ties break to previous block’s symbol to preserve run‑length continuity). This is a Kadanoff‑style decimation.

**Complexity‑reducing RG step.** Define one step of `fractalof` as the pair $(b^*, \theta^*)$ that minimizes description length after coarse‑graining and optional run‑length encoding $RLE$:
$$\operatorname{fractalof}(x) = \underset{b\in\mathcal B,\theta\in\Theta}{\arg\min} \text{ of } \tilde K\big(\operatorname{RLE}_\theta(C_b(x\big))$$
where $\mathcal B$ is a small set of block sizes $e.g.$, ${2,3,4}$ and $\Theta$ parameterizes the RLE code (e.g., Elias‑gamma vs. unary for run lengths). Iterate until convergence.

**Fixed points and idempotency.** Strings of all 0s or all 1s, or perfect periodic tilings with period in $\mathcal B$, are fixed points: further applications leave $\tilde K$ unchanged (idempotency). Noisy data flows to one of a small set of attractors—homogeneous or simple periodic patterns—corresponding to “stable percepts.”

**Interpretation.** The attractor set corresponds to perceptual categories (e.g., “uniform dark,” “uniform bright,” “striped”). The process realizes perception as selection of the *simplest* code consistent with the data, aligning with predictive coding/free‑energy principles but in an explicitly MDL/RG form.

**Lemma (monotonic non‑increase).** If the code for $C_b$ and $\operatorname{RLE}_\theta$ is paid only once (two‑part MDL), then the stepwise description length satisfies $\tilde K(x_{t+1}) \le \tilde K(x_t)$ + $O\log N$. Thus the sequence ${\tilde K(x_t)}$ is non‑increasing up to bounded overhead, ensuring convergence to a finite set of code‑optimal summaries.

## B. 1D Ising Chain — Block‑Spin Decimation with Description Length

**Setup.** Ising spins $s_i\in\{-1,+1\}$ with Hamiltonian $\mathcal H$s$=-J\sum_i s_i s_{i+1} - h\sum_i s_i$. We consider microstates $s$ as bit strings and define a two‑part code: $i$ a *model* $\mathcal M$ specifying coarse parameters (mean magnetization $m$, correlation length $\xi$, and period $p$), and $ii$ *residuals* $\varepsilon$ encoding deviations.

**RG map.** Perform block‑spin decimation: $s'_j = \operatorname{sign}(\sum_{i\in B_j} s_i)$ for disjoint blocks $B_j$ of size $b$. After decimation, re‑estimate ($m',\xi',p'$) by maximum likelihood under a simple Markov model; encode $s'$ using the two‑part MDL:
$$\tilde K(s') = L(\mathcal M') + L(\varepsilon'\mid\mathcal M').$$
Choose $b$ to minimize $\tilde K$. Iterate.

**Fixed points.** For $h\neq 0$, the uniform phases $s_i\equiv\operatorname{sign}(h)$ are fixed points (classical percepts). Near criticality ($h=0, J\approx J_c$), flows stall around scale‑free patterns with slowly decreasing $\tilde K$, reflecting the well‑known critical slowing—interpretable here as “ambiguous percepts.”

**Objectivity via idempotency.** Once the chain has flowed to a uniform or simple periodic code, further decimations chosen by the same criterion do not change the code—realizing `fractalof(fractalof(s)) = fractalof(s)`.

## C. Single Qubit — Basis Search + Thresholded State Reduction

**Setup.** A pure state $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$ with $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$. A conscious reference frame specifies a family of measurement bases $\mathcal B=\{\,|u\rangle,|u_\perp\rangle\,\}$ (e.g., all Bloch directions) and a description language for outcomes over repeated trials.

**Complexity proxy.** For $M$ i.i.d. trials, outcome sequences are Bernoulli with parameter $p=|\langle u|\psi\rangle|^2$. The optimal codelength for the sequence under a universal code is $\tilde K \approx M \cdot H_2(\hat p) + O(\log M)$, where $H_2$ is binary entropy and $\hat p$ the empirical frequency.

**`fractalof` step.** Choose the basis $u^*$ that minimizes expected codelength of outcomes (equivalently, minimizes $H_2(p)$). This is attained when $p\in\{0,1\}$, i.e., when $|\psi\rangle$ aligns with $|u^*\rangle$ or $|u^*_\perp\rangle$. After selecting $u^*$, apply a *thresholded reduction*: if $p>1-\epsilon$, set percept to $|u^*\rangle$; if $p<\epsilon$, set percept to $|u^*_\perp\rangle$; otherwise retain superposed *pre‑percept* and repeat with larger $M$ (gather more evidence). This yields a flow to delta‑entropy fixed points ($H_2=0$).

**Interpretation.** Quantum measurement here appears as the choice of basis that minimizes expected description length of future data, with collapse as convergence to a zero‑entropy attractor—an MDL‑rationalized “eigenbasis selection.”

## D. Pseudocode $Generic `fractalof` Iteration$

```text
Input: state S (bitstring, spin config, or dataset),
       basis/model family F, complexity proxy $K_tilde$(·),
       coarse-grain operators C_θ ∈ F, stopping tol δ.

repeat
  # 1$ Search over admissible coarse-grainings / bases
  θ* := argmin_θ  [  K_tilde( Encode ( C_θ(S) ) ) ]

  # 2$ Apply the best coarse-graining
  S' := C_{θ*}(S)

  # 3$ Check improvement
  if K_tilde(Encode(S') ≥ K_tilde(Encode)(S) − δ then
       return S   # fixed point (idempotent up to δ)
  else
       S := S'
  end if
until convergence
```

**Guarantees.** With a finite model family $F$ and prefix‑free codes, the loop terminates in at most $O(\log |\Sigma|\cdot N)$ iterations because $\tilde K$ is a non‑negative integer and decreases by at least one bit per improving step (for $\delta<1$). The returned $S$ satisfies approximate idempotency: re‑running yields no further decrease within tolerance.

## E. Empirical Hooks and Predictions

1. **Neural data compression.** For cortical spike trains or LFPs, instantiate $C_\theta$ as temporal binning + dictionary learning; predict that conscious report correlates with plateaus of $\tilde K$ (compression ratio maxima), whereas pre‑conscious processing sits on the descending slope.
2. **Psychophysics of ambiguity.** In bistable stimuli (e.g., Necker cube), $\tilde K$ for both dominant percept codes should be comparably minimal, with switching driven by small fluctuations in $\tilde K$ due to noise/adaptation.
3. **Quantum experiments.** In adaptive measurement on single photons/qubits, a `fractalof` controller that greedily minimizes expected codelength should pick measurement axes converging to eigenbases faster (in sample complexity) than non‑adaptive baselines.

## F. Relation Back to the Core Axiom

These toy models show how a basis‑dependent, recursive operator can drive states toward *fractal attractors* (simple codes): homogeneous/periodic patterns for classical fields and eigenstates for qubits. They instantiate qualia as *algorithms of reduction*—the concrete choice of $C_\theta$, code family, and stopping rule—thereby operationalizing the TOAE claim that perception is complexity minimization within a conscious reference frame.
