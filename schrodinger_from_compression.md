# Deriving the Schrödinger Equation from Compression Principles

## 1) Postulates (what we assume)

1. **State of knowledge** about a particle (mass m) at time t is a probability density ρ(x,t) on configuration space and a phase field S(x,t) that generates a current v = ∇S/m.  
2. **Dynamics = optimal compression** of the state’s spatial structure subject to ordinary physical constraints. “Compression” is made concrete as minimizing the **Fisher information content** (a measure of spatial roughness/description length) of ρ.  
3. We must still respect **probability flow** (continuity) and ordinary **energetics** (potential V(x,t)).  
4. A single constant with units of action, call it ħ, sets the scale of the information–action tradeoff (it will drop out as the Lagrange multiplier and calibrates to experiment).

## 2) The compression functional

Use a Lagrangian density that balances:
- a “coding cost” (Fisher information) that penalizes unnecessary structure in ρ, and
- standard kinetic/potential terms expressed in the hydrodynamic (Madelung) variables (ρ,S).

Define the action

$$
\mathcal{A}[\rho,S] = \int dt \int d^3x\;
\Bigg\{
\rho\,(\partial_t S + \tfrac{(\nabla S)^2}{2m} + V)
+ \frac{\hbar^2}{8m}\,\frac{|\nabla \rho|^2}{\rho}
\Bigg\}.
$$

Interpretation:
- The first term enforces energy accounting and probability flow.  
- The second term is the Fisher information density, i.e., the **compression penalty**; minimizing it prefers smoother, more compressible probability fields unless the constraints demand structure.

## 3) Variation → Euler–Lagrange equations

- Variation w.r.t. S gives the **continuity equation**:

$$
\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot\Big(\rho\,\frac{\nabla S}{m}\Big)=0.
$$

- Variation w.r.t. ρ gives the **quantum Hamilton–Jacobi (QHJ) equation**:

$$
\partial_t S + \frac{(\nabla S)^2}{2m} + V - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\,\frac{\nabla^2\sqrt{\rho}}{\sqrt{\rho}} = 0.
$$

The extra term

$$
Q = -\,\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\,\frac{\nabla^2\sqrt{\rho}}{\sqrt{\rho}}
$$

is the **quantum potential**, arising directly from the Fisher information penalty.

## 4) Package (ρ,S) into a wavefunction

Define the complex field

$$
\psi(x,t) = \sqrt{\rho(x,t)}\,e^{\,i S(x,t)/\hbar}.
$$

This transforms the continuity + QHJ equations into

$$
i\hbar\,\partial_t \psi = \Big(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V\Big)\,\psi,
$$

i.e., the **time-dependent Schrödinger equation**.

## 5) Interpretation

- **Quantum dynamics emerges as the unique fixed point** where:
  - Probability flow and energy bookkeeping are respected, and  
  - The state description is optimally compressible (minimizing Fisher information).  

- The quantum term is the shadow of the compression drive.  
- ħ is the tradeoff scale, fixed empirically.

---

## 6) Sanity checks

- **Classical limit**: ħ → 0 eliminates the compression penalty, recovering classical Hamilton–Jacobi mechanics.  
- **Interference**: arises naturally from multi-path compression encoded in the phase.  
- **Uniqueness**: Fisher information is essentially the only local, Galilean-invariant compression functional.

## 7) Bottom line

Schrödinger’s equation is not arbitrary—it is the **equation of motion that best compresses probabilistic descriptions of reality under physical constraints**.
